*Disclaimer: This project is currently on its premises, as only a few alternatives and attributes are available.*

## Direct access

If you want to try the BLADE project online, a live demo is available on [this website](https://blade.nextnet.top/)!

## Setup

If you want to manually use the decision process, go inside the *blade* folder. However, the following method provides an automatic way of installing the project and use it through a web interface.

1. Install Docker

Please follow the corresponding documentation for your platform on [Docker's](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) website.

2. Launch the platform

To launch the platform, simply run in your terminal:

```bash
make build && make run
```

The script will boot up the platform, and you will be able to access it through [localhost](http://localhost:5000). If you want to turn it off, you can use the following command:

```bash
make stop
```
